Add links to:
- ACL anthology profile https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/people/j/jonathan-k-kummerfeld/
- ACM (also claim the profile?) https://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81470655916

Change paging of lists of posts, so they don't get updated every time a post is added. Maybe switch to year-month specific pages?

Look into an affix menu for publication years:

Try to add a small menu at the top of publications, to filter to a particular
year, like in the projects widget or in the publications section.
