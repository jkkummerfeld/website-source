We propose "targeted summarization" as an umbrella category for summarization tasks that intentionally consider only parts of the input data. This covers query-based summarization, update summarization, and a new task we propose where the goal is to summarize a particular aspect of a document. However, collecting data for this new task is hard because directly asking annotators (e.g., crowd workers) to write summaries leads to data with low accuracy when there are a large number of facts to include.  We introduce a novel crowdsourcing workflow, Pin-Refine, that allows us to collect highquality summaries for our task, a necessary step for the development of automatic systems.},
