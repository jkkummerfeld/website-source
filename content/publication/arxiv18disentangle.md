We created a new dataset that is 25 times the size of any previous publicly available resource, has samples of conversation from 152 points in time across a decade, and is annotated with both threads and a within-thread reply-structure graph. We also developed a new neural network model, which extracts conversation threads substantially more accurately than prior work. Using our annotated data and our model we tested assumptions in prior work, revealing major issues in heuristically constructed resources, and identifying how small datasets have biased our understanding of multi-party multi-conversation chat.},
