abstract: Extensive work has argued in favour of paying crowd workers a wage that is at least equivalent to the U.S.~federal minimum wage. Meanwhile, research on collecting high quality annotations (e.g.~for Natural Language Processing) suggests using qualifications such as a minimum number of previously completed tasks. If most requesters who pay fairly use this kind of minimum qualification, then workers may be forced to complete a substantial amount of poorly paid work for other requesters before they can earn a fair wage. This paper (1) explores current conventions for the threshold, (2) discusses possible alternatives, and (3) presents a study of correlation between approved work and work quality.
