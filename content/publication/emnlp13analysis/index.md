abstract: Coreference resolution metrics quantify errors but do not analyze them. Here, we consider an automated method of categorizing errors in the output of a coreference system into intuitive underlying error types. Using this tool, we first compare the error distributions across a large set of systems, then analyze common errors across the top ten systems, empirically characterizing the major unsolved challenges of the coreference resolution task.
