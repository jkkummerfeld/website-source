**My work:**
I aim to make language a complementary part of the interface for any application (e.g. from desktop spreadsheets to mobile apps).
This involves solving a range of fascinating challenges through new methods in Artificial Intelligence and Crowdsourcing.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [University of Michigan](https://www.cse.umich.edu/), working on Natural Language Processing and Crowdsourcing.
I completed my Ph.D. in the [UC Berkeley NLP Group](http://nlp.cs.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Dan Klein](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~klein), and my B.Sc. in the University of Sydney Schwa Lab, advised by [James Curran](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/james-r-curran.html).

**I am on the job market!** I am interested in both academic and industry opportunities, but not quantitative finance.
