**This cycle (2020-2021) I will be on the job market!**

My email address is: jkummerf@umich.edu

My {{% staticref "doc/jonathan-kummerfeld-cv.pdf" %}}CV{{% /staticref %}} is available as a pdf.

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow, working at the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/), in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.umich.edu/).
I work on a range of projects at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Crowdsourcing.

I completed my PhD in the [UC Berkeley NLP Group](http://nlp.cs.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Dan Klein](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~klein), with a thesis on new algorithms related to syntactic parsing: error analysis, formalism conversion, and graph parsing.
I completed my BSc (Adv) with honours and medal in the University of Sydney Schwa Lab advised by [James Curran](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/james-r-curran.html), with a thesis on an algorithm for faster CCG parsing.
I received my Higher School Certificate at [Emanuel School](http://www.emanuelschool.nsw.edu.au/), receiving the Premier's Award for my results in English, Mathematics, Physics, and Cosmology.
