My email address is: jkummerf@umich.edu

My {{% staticref "doc/jonathan-kummerfeld-cv.pdf" %}}CV{{% /staticref %}} is available as a pdf.

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow, working at the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/), in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.umich.edu/).
I am based in the [Crowds+Machines lab](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wlasecki/croma.html), working on a range of projects at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Crowdsourcing.
In particular, I am improving our ability to generalise models across domains by combining human and machine effort in novel ways.
I am also part of the [Language and Information Technologies group](http://lit.eecs.umich.edu/) and advise the NLP research team at [Clinc](https://clinc.com/).

I completed my PhD in the [UC Berkeley NLP Group](http://nlp.cs.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Dan Klein](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~klein), with a thesis on new algorithms related to syntactic parsing: error analysis, formalism conversion, and graph parsing.
I completed my BSc (Adv) with honours and medal in the [University of Sydney Schwa Lab](http://www.schwa.org) advised by [James Curran](http://sydney.edu.au/engineering/it/~james), with a thesis on an algorithm for faster CCG parsing.
I received my Higher School Certificate at [Emanuel School](http://www.emanuelschool.nsw.edu.au/), receiving the Premier's Award for my results in English, Mathematics, Physics, and Cosmology.
