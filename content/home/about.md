My email address is: jkummerf@umich.edu

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow, working at the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/), in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.umich.edu/).
My research focus is Natural Language Processing - in particular, I am working on [Project Sapphire](https://sapphire.eecs.umich.edu), a collaboration with IBM, developing a conversational academic adviser.
I am also affiliated with two research groups: [Language and Information Technologies](http://lit.eecs.umich.edu/), and [Crowds+Machines](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wlasecki/croma.html).

I completed my PhD in the [UC Berkeley NLP Group](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wlasecki/croma.html), advised by [Dan Klein](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~klein), with a thesis on new algorithms related to syntactic parsing: error analysis, formalism conversion, and graph parsing.
I completed my BSc (Adv) with honours and medal in the [University of Sydney Schwa Lab](http://www.schwa.org) advised by [James Curran](http://sydney.edu.au/engineering/it/~james), with a thesis on an algorithm for faster CCG parsing.
I received my Higher School Certificate at [Emanuel School](http://www.emanuelschool.nsw.edu.au/), receiving the Premier's Award for my results in English, Mathematics, Physics, and Cosmology.
